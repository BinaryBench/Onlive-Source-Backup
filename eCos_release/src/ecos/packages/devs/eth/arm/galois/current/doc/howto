This's ethernet on CPU#0 (half-duplex 100Mbps) by-default how to:

1. After check out, overlap repository ecos.db with ecos.db here
2. run ecosconfig tool to create compilation tree.
3. In the tree, add one line "include $(REPOSITORY)/pkgconf/galois_rules.mak" before the last
line "include $(REPOSITORY)/pkgconf/rules.mak" in "galois_cesnet/devs/eth/arm/galois/current/makefile".
NOTE: please make sure that galois_rules.mak has the correct GaloisSoftware directory in your PC.

NOTE: please refer to packages/templates/cesnet/ for a reference.


NOTE:
RTOS programming: avoid startvation
THREAD			PRIORITY
cyg_cpuload_calibrate: 1
cyg_alarm_timeout_init: 6
cyg_net_init: 7
dhcp_mgt_thread: 8
cyg_sntp_start: 8
tftpd_start: 10

So if someone calls dhcp client, please prevent that it's starved by other higher priority threads,
such as main().
